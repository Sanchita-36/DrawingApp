# DrawingApp
This app has been built as a sample app. 
Idea behind this app is to provide a canvas to draw, change colors, change bursh stroke size, save the image and clear the canvas.
Added Pinch gesture in this app.

Configurations: Swift 5, Xcode version: 11.5 , MacOS version: 10.15.7
I am still a learner trying to build good applications and get good understanding of iOS Development.
